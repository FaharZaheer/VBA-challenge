To run the code, under VBA development window, please use File -> Import File... (Crtl +M) and import "Wall_street.bas" file.
Once this file is imported, you will have access to "Run_wall_street_On_all_sheets" and "Wall_Street" macros.

To run the code only on one sheet, just use "Wall_street".
To run the code on all the sheets by just running one macro, just use "Run_wall_street_On_all_sheets".
